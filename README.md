# Shortwave Listener Buddy

This is a project which aims to provide a collection of tools to help shortwave
listeners around the world.

The first goal is to create a simple schedule organizer so that users can quickly
search and browse for stations, after this is done I can focus on creating other
utilities like a logger for example.
